## ðŸ§  Model Used

We use IBMâ€™s **Granite 3B Instruct** model in GGUF format (`granite-3b-2b-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`). This quantized model runs locally using `llama-cpp-python`, enabling efficient, GPU-free inference.

> **Note**: The model file is **not included** in the repository due to its size.
